            <p class="grid-text">Structural Engineering
              1 Structural engineers are responsible for the detailed analysis and design of:
              Architectural structures: Buildings, houses, factories. They must work in close cooperation
              with an architect who will ultimately be responsible for the design.
              Civil Infrastructures: Bridges, dams, pipelines, offshore structures. They work with transportation, hydraulic, nuclear and other engineers. For those structures they play the
              leading role.
              Aerospace, Mechanical, Naval structures: aeroplanes, spacecrafts, cars, ships, submarines
              to ensure the structural safety of those important structures.
              2.2 Structures and their Surroundings
              2 Structural design is affected by various environmental constraints:
              1. Major movements: For example, elevator shafts are usually shear walls good at resisting
              lateral load (wind, earthquake).
              2. Sound and structure interact:
              • A dome roof will concentrate the sound
              • A dish roof will diffuse the sound
              3. Natural light:
              • A flat roof in a building may not provide adequate light.
              • A Folded plate will provide adequate lighting (analysis more complex).
              • A bearing and shear wall building may not have enough openings for daylight.
              • A Frame design will allow more light in (analysis more complex).
              4. Conduits for cables (electric, telephone, computer), HVAC ducts, may dictate type of
              floor system.
              5. Net clearance between columns (unobstructed surface) will dictate type of framing.</p>

              2. Electrical systems (power, lighting, communication)
              3. Plumbing systems (water supply, drainage, sanitation)
              
              Importance of MEP Drawings
              1. System Design: Ensures efficient and effective design of MEP systems.
              2. Coordination: Facilitates collaboration among architects, engineers, and contractors.

              Surveying involves finding the precise locations of points (e.g., property corners, infrastructure elements) on the ground. 
              Measuring distances and angles:
              It uses various tools and techniques to accurately measure the distances, directions, and angles between these points. 
              Creating maps:
              The data collected during surveying is used to create maps, which are visual representations of the surveyed area. 
              Tools and techniques:
              Surveying uses instruments like GPS, total stations, levels, and aerial photography to collect data. 
              Importance and Applications:
              Civil Engineering and Construction: Surveying is crucial for planning, design, and construction of roads, buildings, and other infrastructure. 
              Urban Planning: It helps in developing urban areas and managing land use. 
              Environmental Science: Surveying data can be used to study and manage natural resources. 
              Property Management: Land surveying is essential for determining property boundaries and ensuring accurate land ownership. 
              Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Surveying data is a key input for creating and managing GIS systems. 
              Types of Surveying:
              Surveying can be categorized based on the type of information being collected and the tools used. Some common types include:
              Land Surveying: Focuses on determining the boundaries and dimensions of land parcels. 
              Topographic Surveying: Creates detailed maps of the Earth's surface, including elevation changes. 
              Geodetic Surveying: Deals with surveying large areas of the Earth, considering the curvature of the planet. 
              Hydrographic Surveying: Measures the depths and features of bodies of water. 
              Control Surveying: Establishes a network of survey monuments to provide a framework for other types .</p>

              General construction typically refers to the overall process and management of building projects, encompassing various stages from initial planning to completion. This includes the oversight of a construction site, managing vendors and trades, and ensuring effective communication among all parties involved, according to Wikipedia.
              Here's a more detailed breakdown:
              Key Aspects of General Construction:
              Project Management:
              This involves planning, organizing, and overseeing the entire building project, ensuring it is completed on time and within budget.
              Site Management:
              This includes managing the physical construction site, including safety, logistics, and ensuring all work is carried out according to plans and regulations.
              Vendor and Trade Management:
              This involves selecting, managing, and coordinating various contractors, subcontractors, and tradespeople who are involved in the construction.
              Communication:
              Maintaining clear and effective communication with all stakeholders, including clients, architects, engineers, and other team members, is crucial throughout the project.
              Quality Control:
              Ensuring that the building project adheres to the required quality standards and specifications.
              Safety:
              Implementing and maintaining safety protocols and procedures on the construction site.</p>

            <h4 class="grid-title">Renovation Services</h4>
            <p class="grid-text">Renovation (also called remodeling) is the process of improving broken, damaged, or outdated structures. Renovations are typically done on either commercial or residential buildings. Additionally, renovation can refer to making something new, or bringing something back to life and can apply in social contexts. For example, a community can be renovated if it is strengthened and revived. It can also be restoring something to a former better state (as by cleaning, repairing, or rebuilding). Renovation is very common in some places.Other types of renovations also can be initiated for similar reasons. The user or owner of a building can change which can effect the needs or wants for the space prompting a renovation. This is becoming more popular as buildings owners are renting or leasing floors or sections of the buildings to companies which have different spacial requirements than the previous users causing needed renovation. Renovations can also occur as companies increase size which could lead to needed additional retail, office, or other types of spaces. Similarly to homes other building owners could also want renovations to increased value, make the building more energy efficient, green or sustainable, or to update the building.</p>
